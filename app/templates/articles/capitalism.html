You cannot in one breath describe capitalism as a virtuous economic system and in the next talk about how we must rally behind local small businesses rather than shopping at Amazon, the poster child of the capitalist economic system.

You need to pick a side. If you're for capitalism, then you must necessarily be for the natural selection that makes it such a powerhouse. Capital is naturally concentrated in the businesses most fit for servicing a demand. A consequence of this is that much of the commerce in your neighbourhood, town and city cannot compete with a well-oiled, multinational and -- being a proponent of the flow of capital to the most fit for servicing a demand -- you must accept the death of said commerce.

Here's where you might expect a critic of capitalism to jump at the chance to say "socialism  -- *true* socialism -- would solve this!" Here's the thing though: there's nothing stopping a massive, multinational co-op from undercutting the prices of your local toy store and driving them out of business. Any society in which there is a free market (something which neither socialism nor communism advocate against) is open to such a possibility. The difference is what happens with the money. In a capitalist economic order, the goal has always been.

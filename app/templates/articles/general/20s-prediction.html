    This is it.

    This is the age of AI.

    all those photos and videos of you in the cloud describing who you are and what you're doing
    Little cindy playing with her dog
    Michael drinking his fifth beer at the christmas party
    the images, the desrciptions, the links, the likes
    that's data
    It been converted to ones and zeros and its now sitting in a server farm somewhere, being processed and reprocessed over and over and in the process gulping in electrical energy and spitting out environmental nuisances

<p>
    Both the public and the private sector are racing as fast as they can

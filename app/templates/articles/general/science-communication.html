    The lack of discussions on the nature of AI becomes easy to understand when you consider the current state of the news. News corporations (and even regular netizens) can now immediately see how many people interacted with their content. When you have this information at your disposal, you quickly realize that the best way to earn that sweet, sweet attention (and maybe even ad revenue) is to make the information entertaining, if not click-baitable.

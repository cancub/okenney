your daughter
one day she wants to get her hair cut a bit differently. Really short in, in fact. We're talking buzzcut. You're thinking it wouldn't be my first choice, but she's 13 and it seems to make her happy rather than mean. That's a plus no matter way you slice it.
It's not like she's getting in with the wrong crowd. All her friends are goodhearted people, which gives you peace of mind when they do their teenager things together.
You notice that she hasn't really warn dresses in a while

and what if she were just a little more masculine,
and what if it all happened overnight
	she'd been wanting

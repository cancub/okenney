compassionate and pragmatic existential nihilism

start with evolution
we had an ancient ancestor like a fish.
does a fish have free will?
does an amoeba?
no
why not?
then where along the evolutionary chain did this change and why
if we do not have free will then everything in life is either random or deterministic
if that's the case then there is no meaning to life and any "finding" meaning doesn't make sense. _Making_ meaning, however does.
and if its true that there is no meaning to life and we are just animals taking external input and producing outputs in the forms of actions, then 
this is all just a ride
some people are sitting in the front seat, laughing and enjoying themselves on this ride thanks to the luck of being born into a good scenario: good brain, good family, good mentors, good opportunities
some people, however pull the short straw.
they're sitting in the back.
they're watching the people up front have a grand old time, safely strapped in while at the back of the ride, the safety harness has been broken for some time
some of them might even feel anger that they were even put on this ride in the first place
they were given a bad brain, a bad family, bad mentors or bad opportunities
they'd like to get the front where its safe
but the people at the front certainly aren't going to allow someone from the back to just take a seat without "earning" it
